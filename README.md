# Cryptomine
This a simple attempt of simulating a Blockchain System; with the usage of caesar ciphers and API endpoints in the language GO. 


# Blockchain Implementation in Go
This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Go. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology including creating blocks, mining blocks with proof-of-work, and maintaining the integrity of the chain.

## Features
<ul> 
  <li> Creation of individual blocks with transactions </li>
  <li> Proof-of-work implementation for mining blocks </li>
   <li>Validation of the blockchain's integrity</li>
<li> RESTful API to interact with the blockchain </li>
<li> Console operations for testing </li>
</ul>


## Getting Started 
 <b> Prerequisites </b>
<ul> 
  <li> Go (Golang) installed on your system </li>
  <li> Gin installation </li>
  <li> Godot installation </li>
  <li> Basic understanding of Go and RESTful APIs </li>
</ul>

### There are commands and the imports you can refer to within the repo. 

<h4> Side comments: </h4>
<li> Further improvements can be made by maintainence of the code and modularizing them into different files
ex: util, models, main, blockchain, blocks, api, etc. </li>
<li> I can use additional ciphers to enhance the security of the hash. (Intend to down the line.) </li>
<li> I can improve the hashing algorithm as the time complexity is O(n). </li>
<li> I intend to add UI/UX design to this simple blockchain so the user can do the API request and visualize the handles/functions </li>
<li> Add more scalability with the keys and the blocks. </li>
